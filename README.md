# Bank Marketing Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various predictive models aimed at predicting subscription to term deposits by clients of a bank. The models analyze client data from direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) to predict whether clients will subscribe to term deposits.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a client will subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to a term deposit as part of direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.

## Dataset
The dataset involves records from direct marketing campaigns of a bank, which are primarily phone calls. There are 45,210 samples with 17 features, including job type, marital status, education level, and previous campaign outcomes.

### Features
- **Categorical**: Job, marital status, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, poutcome.
- **Numerical**: Age, balance, day, duration, campaign, pdays, previous.

### Target Variable
- **Deposit**: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').
